<h4 style="margin-top: 0;"> <strong> In conjunction with the <br />  
<a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2023/" target="_blank"> <strong> ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2023 </strong> </a> </strong> </h4>

## Background

The Joint Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy (CPSIoTSec) is the result of the merger of the Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems Security and Privacy (CPS-SPC) and Workshop on the Internet of Things Security and Privacy (IoTS&P) previously organized annually in conjunction with ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.



## Scope
The Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy (CPSIoTSec 2023) invites academia, industry, and governmental entities to submit:

* Original research papers on the security and privacy of CPS&IoT
* Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers on the security and privacy of CPS&IoT
* Demos (hands-on or videos) of testbeds/experiences of CPS&IoT security and privacy research

We seek submissions from multiple interdisciplinary backgrounds tackling security and privacy issues in CPS&IoT, including but not limited to:
* Mathematical foundations for secure CPS/IoT
* Control-theoretic approaches
* High assurance security architectures
* Security and resilience metrics
* Metrics and risk assessment approaches
* Identity and access management
* Privacy and trust
* Network security
* Game theory applied to CPS/IoT security
* Human factors, humans in the loop, and usable security
* Understanding dependencies among security, reliability and safety in CPS/IoT
* Economics of security and privacy
* Intrusion and anomaly detection
* Model-based security systems engineering
* Sensor and actuator attacks
* CPS/IoT malware analysis
* CPS/IoT firmware analysis
* Hardware-assisted CPS/IoT security


Also of interest will be papers that can point the research community to new research directions,
and those that can set research agendas and priorities in CPS/IoT security and privacy.
**There will be a best paper award.**





## Submission Guidelines


Submissions include ***long papers (12 pages)***, ***short papers (6 pages)***, or ***1-page abstracts***:
* Long papers include a) Original research on a CPS/IoT security and privacy topic, b) Systematization
of Knowledge of CPS/IoT security and privacy;
* Short papers include original work-in-progress research on a CPS/IoT security and privacy
topic;
* 1-page abstracts include demos/interesting findings/insights on CPS/IoT security and privacy,
which will be accompanied by a hands-on demo during the workshop.

Submitted papers can be **up to 12 or 6 pages** excluding appendices and references, and should
provide enough details to **enable reproducibility**. All submitted papers must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references, for **double blind reviews**. Submissions must use the ACM SIG Proceedings
Templates (see <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>, with a simpler version here:
<a href="https://github.com/acmccs/format" target="_blank">https://github.com/acmccs/format</a>).
Only PDF files will be accepted.

Accepted papers will be published by the ACM Press and/or the ACM Digital Library. We expect all authors to consider diversity and inclusion,
especially when preparing their own submission (see <a href="https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/about" target="_blank">https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/about</a>). Submissions must not
substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted
to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Each accepted paper must be presented by a registered
author. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk immediate rejection. For questions
about these policies, please contact the chairs.
